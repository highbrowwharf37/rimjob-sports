```

## Quick Start

### 1. Generate NBA Data Files
First, convert the CSV files to JSON (required for the web interface):

```bash
python build_nba_json.py
```

This creates the `nba_data/` directory with all necessary JSON files.

### 2. Start the Local Server
Launch the development server:

```bash
python serve.py
```

Output:
```
🚀 Server running at http://localhost:8000
📊 Open http://localhost:8000/nba_stats.html in your browser
   Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
```

### 3. Open in Browser
