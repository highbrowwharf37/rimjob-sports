"""
Create unique weekly fantasy football lineups from player_points_above_cutoff.csv.

A lineup contains:
- 1 QB
- 2 RB
- 2 WR
- 1 TE
- 2 FLEX (RB/WR/TE)

Lineups are treated as unique regardless of swapping players between same-position
slots and FLEX slots. For example, a lineup with the same QB and the same set of
RB/WR/TE players is written only once.

To avoid accidentally generating an unmanageable number of rows, the script
estimates the lineup count for each week and skips weeks above --max-lineups
unless --force is provided.
